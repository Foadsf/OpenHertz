# OpenHertz
OpenHertz is a Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) for Hertzian contact calculations.

## Installation:

- No installation is required. Just go to [the website](https://foadsf.github.io/OpenHertz/) and start using it. 

- But if you want to use it locally, download this repository in ZIP format and unarchive it somewhere on your computer.

## Instructions:

- run the `index.html` file
- Choose the type of contact:

    * Sphere-Plane (R)
    * Sphere-Sphere (R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>2</sub>)
    * Cylinder-Plane (R)
    * Cylinder-Cylinder (R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>2</sub>)

- If the ‚ÄúCylinder-Cylinder‚Äù option is selected, then the relative orientation of the cylinders needs to be determined:
    * Parallel
    * Perpendicular
    <!-- * Angled (Œ±) -->

- Next, depending on the option selected on the first step, one or two radii should be determined
<!-- - If the two sides of the contact are different materials or the same will be determined next. -->
- Mechanical properties of the material(s) will be given to the software after that. Young elastic modulus (E), Poisson ratio (ŒΩ), and Yield strength (œÉ<sub>Y</sub>) will be given.
- After all, the software will report the results automatically

<!-- ## FAQ: -->

<!-- - Why not supporting the imperial system of units? Please grow up, US! -->
<!-- - Why not have a graphical user interface (GUI)? Who knows, maybe in the future it will be added -->
<!-- - Why writing a software in PowerShell? It seems like the only scripting language included in all the Windows corporate machines that the potential audience of this software use. -->

## Contribution:

These are the areas I need the most help:

* I need to add Imperial system of units
* I know nothing about frontend development, or programing for that matter. My code is a text book example of Spaghetti code. Please help me reformat it and make it more maintainable.
* I need to add other contact types:

  * elliptical
  * perpendicular cylinders
  * sphere in a cup
  * cylinder in a cylindrical groove

## Support:

If you can't contribute by code but you want to support the project, here are the things you can do, ordered from the easiest:

* Star this repository on the upper right corner of this page ‚òù
* Introduce this tool to your friends, colleagues, students, grandmas üòé, ... 
* Put the link to this repo on your website, blog, social media ... spread the word
* Follow me on Twitter ![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/fsfarimani?label=Follow&style=social), or endorse me on LinkedIn [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fsfarimani/)


* If you do really use tool for profit you can sponsor me up there as well, most probably I will pay most of it back to the FLOSS community again.
